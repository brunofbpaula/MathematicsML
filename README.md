## Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization
Repository for pratice while I'm undertaking DeepLearningAI's Mathematics for Machine Learning anda Data Science Specialization. The specialization is made up of three courses about Linear Algebra, Calculus & Probability and Statistics, respectively.

Please notice that the focus here is on building a strong mathematical foundation and not programming itself. Personally, I prefer to handwrite most of the course's content in my physical notebook. Knowing that, you can find here some jupyter notebooks I created during the specialization.
